# Given the length of a vector will calculate and print Verilog
# statements needed to extract a number of 32-bit words from
# the vector.
#
# The vector is assumed to be in the format [(n-1)..0] where n
# is the given number of bits. The vector is considered to
# be a byte representation of a sequence of bytes from left to
# right. This means that the first byte is in bits
# [(n-1)..(n-8)].
#
# Based on this 32-bit lsb words are extracted from left to
# right in increasing order. this means that LSB for word0
# is in bits [(n-1)..(n-8)] of the vector.
#
# Simple, isn't it? ;-)
